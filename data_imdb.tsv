Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness	7.4	I don't always agree with the professional critics, but I have to say that I do agree this adaption, is, without a doubt, the most turgid and poorly executed Christie adaption that there has been.There is over an hour of the film before the mystery even begins and that interminable hour consists of exposition that leave the characters as two dimensional as when it started. And half of the characters seem shoveled in with no purpose whatsoever. E.g. Sophie Okonedo. She is a great actress. Perhaps the best in this cast. I strongly recommend people see her Hollow Crown and Hotel Rwanda. But her character (or that of the character's niece) in Death on the Nile is what? Serves what plot purpose? (Answer: none)The actual "solving" of the mystery has to be the most predictable Christie adaption ever. It is a outright "Cui bono?" It makes it clear this is written for very low brow audience.

The Batman	8.0	An epic film with a straightforward story and effective use of Norse mythology. Its intense rituals, powerful imagery, guttural and pounding music and display of culture in its authentic setting makes for an entertaining and memorable experience. Stunning scenery, brutal and bloody fight scenes and great acting performances, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
The Lost City	6.2	Robert P is a terrible Batman. Absolutely no Bat-charisma at all. The Riddler character is a complete bore! I hated all of this film. I certainly do not understand the good reviews. It's not close to the Dark Knight caliber. Please do not make a sequel.
Everything Everywhere All at Once	8.6	A rehash of Romancing the Stone.Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is the reclusive widowed novelist on a book tour to promote her book 'The Lost City of D.'Alan Caprisan (Channing Tatum) is the model who plays the fictional Dash McMahon, the heroic adventurer of her novels.When Loretta is kidnapped by eccentric Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) because she used ancient hieroglyphics in her book that could lead to a real lost city.Alan has to turn into a real life hero to rescue Loretta. However everyone else thinks that this is a tacky publicity stunt from her publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph.)This is a shallow, daft screwball comedy. It is entertaining enough as everyone knows this is a tongue in cheek homage to the Michael Douglas/Kathleen Turner movie. Radcliffe has the most fun as the villain.Brad Pitt shows up as a real life hero who initially goes to rescue Loretta.

Senior Year	5.6	Very poor, poor effects, poor story, cheesy, so disappointed with this. If you are going to remake a cult classic, then have a look at what made it a classic to start. This is just a lifeless boring sham. If you loved the original film, give this a miss, if you haven't seen the original, then it might just about keep you awake.
Operation Mincemeat	6.7	Despite being a formulaic clich√©, this does have an interesting satirical element. Of course all the tired tropes are there, unrequited love, wonder at technology development and child in a woman's body.The intriguing part is the stark contrast in sensibilities over twenty years. Naturally it is caricatured for comedic effect, but perhaps we have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. Some horrible practices have been discontinued, but at the expense of sanitising our interactions.Sadly this social commentary is insufficient to make this a good movie despite the delightful Rebel Wilson. It is mediocre at best, with a weak, stale story, clumsy dialogue and an insurmountable suspension-of-disbelief requirement.
365 Days: This Day	2.5	The main difference between The Man Who Never Was (1956) and this, Operation Mincemeat (2021), is that filmmakers seem to consider 21st century audiences dumb who need everything explained slowly to them. Or, perhaps the filmmakers are such simpletons as they presume their audience to be. Also, it seems that these days the facts, as intriguing as they may be, are not considered enough to make an interesting movie and therefore unnecessary embellishments with invented lies and subplots are deemed a must.The only thing that keeps this movie half-afloat is the regal presence of Colin Firth. The rest is total BS, mostly invented to make the movie drag on for 25 minutes longer than the original.The 1956 original was handicapped by the fact that the facts were still classified and yet they created a brilliantly paced and presented narrative of as close to the truth as they could get. This 2021 outing had all the facts, declassified since 1996, but felt the need to invent fairytales to embellish it with.Is this a good movie to watch if one does not care about the facts it claims to depict? Run-of-the-mill formula. Nothing special. No memorable moments. Formulaic standard recipe doing an injustice to one of the greatest successes in history involving the deception of the enemy. Cringeworthy moments in the narrative. Not one moment that rouses an emotional response from the viewer.
Uncharted	6.4	Biggest regret of my lifeAfter the opening scene I thought that it couldn't get worse but somehow it did, and it kept going...
I'm actually amazed they managed to create something that awful ?!
Doctor Strange	7.5	Obvious cgi, plot holes, and lack of character depth made uncharted fall in the kind of lame category. Some funny moments between Wahlberg and Holland and decent sets. It was just too unbelievable.
365 dni	3.3	I'm not a big fan of Marvel and, in my opinion, their movies are mostly overrated. This one isn't. This is probably the second best Marvel movie, after "Guardians of the Galaxy". If you expect a movie to have depth and the point, you should skip, not only this one, but whole Marvel production, but if you are looking for fun you are at the right place. Visually it is amazing. I recommend watching it in theater or at least on a TV as big as possible. Standard computer monitors or, God forbid, tablets are out of question. Although 90% of this movie is pure action and fighting scenes, compared to most of the genre, story and characterization are more complete and Benedict and Tilda are excellent. Sure, like in all Marvel movies, there is a certain amount of humor and finale is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in Marvel movies. The way Strange finally defeats the enemy is at the same time unbelievably stupid, unbelievably clever and funny to tears. I gave it 8/10 within all the movies I ever watched, but within the genre, it is pure 10/10.8/10
Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore	6.4	There is no plot to speak of, the dialogue is disjointed, the storyline is disjointed, and the ending is a joke... but don't kid yourself that you're watching for any of these things.
X	6.7	No surprise that the visuals were breathtaking, some beautiful shots and immersive cinematography. However, there was no depth to the plot. Some lovely character moments.
The Bad Guys	6.9	I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. Some reviews said it was porn with some horror, some said it was a slasher B movie. Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have.
Spider-Man: No Way Home	8.3	The Bad Guys is definitely a step forward for Dreamworks, despite the fact that its script is quite predictable, the characters have a lot of charisma, that together with a more than excellent animation.Its soundtrack is also quite remarkable, a worthy job coming from Daniel Pemberton (Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse composer) this makes the chases and action scenes a visual delight.In conclusion, The Bad Guys is a very good movie that hooks you throughout the movie, it is dynamic and frenetic, with a lesson in morality and emotional moments, It is not a masterpiece like other films from the studio, but if it is moderately successful, we could say that it is the new Dreamworks franchise. Hopefully they improve and refine what was done in this movie in a possible sequel or in other studio projects.
Avatar	7.8	Spiderman Far From Home is to years of stand alone Spider-Man movies what Avenger Endgame was to Avengers: an amazing grand finale to wrap up all the previous adventures in a grand manner, thus allowing a new phase.This allows something very special:
Tobey, Andrew & Tom are no longer three different set of movies, they all come to as one adventure, together.Spidey is now reset to a new beginning (no caretaker, no girlfriend, no best friend). This will allow the building of a whole new story.Because Spidey Tom still remembers it all, this closed chapter can't be dismissed or forgotten, it is the building block of what's to come. It's a bittersweet legacy which opens door to bringing back the past if writers want to go that way at a later stage (after all, a spell can be reversed, most times!).I always loved these three actors, seeing them together was a dream come true I could never have dreamt of in the past. And before you know it, it's already the end of the movie, this is how captivating it is. 10/10 for me for sure!
Death on the Nile	6.3	Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.***¬Ω/****

Sonic the Hedgehog 2	6.6	Back when I worked in the aviation industry 'Top Gun' was always a big deal. Pilots couldn't believe I hadn't seen it. A lot of them even said it was the reason they pursued that career path. I even have a close friend who has it as their favourite movie. And yet it still didn't really interest me. In fact if there wasn't a sequel coming out for it soon I may never have gotten around to watching it. It always seemed to me, from the little I knew about it, that it was a plotless movie. And having seen it that was a correct assessment. The movie isn't really about anything. The only thing that saves it from being a complete dumpster fire is the charisma of the characters.It's funny to watch a movie so old that the line 'I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you" is still included and even gets a laugh from the other characters. The film hasn't really aged that well in a lot of ways. The way the action sequences are filmed can make them quite hard to watch. This is something I hope they do far better in the sequel. I certainly enjoyed the characters interacting on land far more than the often quite lengthy action sequences in the air.The film has some memorable quotes which have aged very well. It also has a very good cast who do an excellent job of lifting the film up and making it what it is. It's not a film I can recommend as a must-watch though unfortunately. There simply isn't enough to it for me to do that.
2000 Mules	7.1	If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a vastly superior sequel to the first adaptation.Jeff Fowler works with his screenwriting team to fix some of the issues with the original flick, successfully managing to create a much less corporate work, more focused on Sonic and, this time, also Tails and Knuckles, in addition to putting humans aside in a subplot that, even so, still bothered more than it should.Taking advantage of phenomenal voice acting from the cast, as well as an already iconic performance by Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, entertainment levels soar tremendously as the action-adventure sequences amaze viewers with praiseworthy animation and visual effects, as well as an engaging main narrative that expands on the origin of the hedgehogs while simultaneously developing the same characters.Fun for kids and adults alike."Rating: B.
The Godfather	9.2	I've been a liberal Democrat since John F Kennedy. I am devastated as to what my party has become, this film provided hard evidence how they stole the election. I didn't want to believe it. I'm immediately changing my voter registration from Democrat to Republican. I didn't leave the Democrat party, the Democrat party left me, I don't recognize it any more. I'm furious to what they did, stolen elections have consequences. Dementia Biden is destroying our country.
Along for the Ride	6.0	Up until today, I haven't bothered to review "The Godfather". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching "The Godfather" and "The Godfather: Part II", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.
The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent	7.4	That award would probably be given to The Longest Ride.Sarah Desson is my favorite young adult author, so I was pleased to see one of her books made into a movie. The book is quite involved, so I understand that they had to make cuts to get it down to a feature length film. They kept enough to make it a good story but I did miss a lot of the book details. They added in new things that could have easily been replaced with the original book content.
The Rum Diary	6.1	When Nick Cage (Nicholas Cage) realizes his finances are disastrous, he agrees to make a one-time appearance at a billionaire's birthday. Once he gets off the plane and meets billionaire Javi (Pedro Pascal), a friendship is struck up. Before Nick can get too comfortable, he finds out that his new billionaire friend is being watched by the CIA, who quickly recruits him to be their new informant.If this film had been made with and about anyone other than Nicolas Cage, I don't think it would have worked. This film was written to highlight some of Cage's best moments in his career, leaving the viewer with Easter eggs galore. The direction of the film taps into the action genre while still being a true comedy. Just when you think it's just a comedy, it switches gears into a crime drama. The cinematography brings you to the gorgeous paradise of the film's setting.As previously stated, Nicolas Cage is fantastic and shows why he's had such a long career. Buddying up with Pedro Pascal is a match made in heaven. These two play off of each other so well. Tiffany Haddish delivers some memorable lines and commands the scene when she's in it. Ike Barinholtz has impeccable comedic timing as always, and the biggest downfall is not having more of him and Haddish. Sharon Horgan and Lily Mo Sheen round out Cage's family, and the dynamic feels pure. You get a true sense of a dysfunctional family that truly loves each other. And last but not least, is Neil Patrick Harris, who plays Cage's agent with gusto.It is hard to find fault with this film. I'm not sure if it's because it is so much fun or because the runtime just flies by. So elements such as the score and other technical areas don't shine too brightly, but I'm not sure they were intended to. Some characters could have used a bit more screen time, but keeping their appearances to a minimum made their moments a little more memorable. Going up a notch in some of the action set pieces would have been the icing on the cake, but now I'm just getting greedy.The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a film that is going to be talked about for years. The way it is constructed and written leaves it as a prime candidate for multiple viewings. It is genuinely laugh-out-loud funny and earns every one of them. I can't wait to watch this one again and again.
Loin du p√©riph	5.7	I have read the book and this movie holds true to the voice that Thompson writes with - this is what makes the movie works. Depp's role, unsurprisingly, mimics his portrayal of Hunter in Fear and Loathing (only with less drugs, not counting alcohol).The movie can, realistically, be summed up in one "revelation" Depp's character has with a rather unusual counterpart. Throughout the film we see examples of the opulent lifestyle of few and downtrodden livings of the many. What Depp confides with his "friend", allows us to use what we have learned up to that point in the movie and chew on for the remainder of the movie, is this - the banks hold the wealth while leaving us (and the starving children) to stare at empty brass plates hanging on their front doors. Whether you agree with it or not, this is not a stretch to compare with the "occupy" movement settling into America and around Europe today.This movie is good. Much like the original book, this movie doesn't try to entertain the viewer; it allows the viewer to sit back and follow along as one man experiences a lifetime of ups and downs in a matter of weeks. And be prepared to go out for a drink afterward, you'll need it.
Ambulance	6.1	Action, funny dialogues and a good Omar Sy as usual. But don't expect too much from the story.Anyway, if you don't have something special to do at a Saturday evening this could work.I spent a good time with my wife and we could laugh a lot. 6/10.
Dune: Part One	8.1	Stylishly directed, jam-packed with chases and keeping the fun aspect alive for the most part if not all the way, Ambulance moves into top gear relatively quick and never takes the foot off the pedal once it gets going but the road it takes to reach its destination ends up being longer than what the gas in the tank can handle, thus resulting in a ride that's running on fumes way before the end is in sight.Directed by Michael Bay, the premise is simple, setup is quick & thrills are endless even if much of the narrative elements seem underdeveloped. Bay utilises his usual unabashed over-the-top approach that provide his standard blockbuster fares an explosive, extravagant flavour and he amplifies the nonstop action some more with kinetic camerawork, chaotic vibe, frenetic editing and wicked character interplay.The energy & passion is evident in execution and the use of drones to film the chase sequences is undoubtedly inspiring but this would've been an even better action-thriller if it was trimmed to a tight & tense 90 mins ride. Jake Gyllenhaal, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II & Eiza Gonz√°lez remain in sync with the craziness on display. And while the interest & momentum isn't lost, one does start to feel its 136 mins runtime in the remaining half.Overall, Ambulance is amusing, entertaining & preposterous in all the ways a Michael Bay film is expected to be but it is also a whole lot of fast fun & furious frivolity that manages to get plenty of mileage out of its barebone premise. The lack of restraint isn't an issue since it is one of the fine qualities of a Bayhem production but its overlong length does leave you feeling more exhausted than exhilarated in the end. In short, a gleeful & enjoyable delight.
Downton Abbey: A New Era	7.7	Finally, we can watch a great adaptation of the famous book. The movie is really nice in different respects. However, I didn't enjoy the end. Technically, it just stops in a middle of the story, which is not pleasant. Especially considering that the work on next chapter will only begin in 2022...
The Gentlemen	7.8	Fans of the tv show and earlier film will get the most out of this, with plenty of dangling plot threads deftly picked up and woven into a satisfying series of resolutions.There's plenty of strongly emotional moments here. It plays like one of the Christmas specials but more so, and combines an appropriately high stakes 19th century historical family mystery with an examination of an industry on the cusp of a revolution, as metaphor for Downton and the Crawleys doing their best to survive in a changing world. Hints are given how they will manage it.This is not the place to start with Downton, and the movie assumes wise viewers know that. With so many characters, with so much history, the audience are given not so much introductions as little reminders.As is traditional, Maggie Smith gets most of the best lines, but there are no weak performances. There's even a scattering of wisdom here and there among the drollery and drama.
Jurassic World Dominion	-	-
Thar	-	-
Aquaman	6.8	If you are unaware of the genre of this film, then not very long into this film when you will easily realize the genre of this film. That's it! From there onwards you pretty much know what the film is going to tell you. This is the biggest underwhelming part of the film ( in fact yesterday only I watched a Tamil film Saani Kayyidham and i could not help but find remarkable similarities between the this film Thar and that Tamil film).When finally the makers reveal the reason why Harshvardhan is in a torture mood, it is just too flat. No emotional connect, everything shown in a montage form, which is why you dont feel for harshvardhan at all. You don't feel the slightest bit of anger for the accused (yeah you might think these are spoilers I am hinting at but mark my words it is so predictable that these are not even spoilers). Story definitely is nothing new and is a let down.Still, it does hold on to your attention atleast the way things move, you want to know why harshvardhan tortures the three guys but you will know that they must have done something to deserve that, its just this "what must they have done" that is left to see in the film.Locations and settings are terrific! Never seen bollywood do this ever with such authentic setting in the desert with good use of BGM, especially that whistle one. This is where the film scores brownie points.Despite a sub par story, the actors have given their best. Anil Kapoor to harshvardhan to Satish Kauahik to Fatima, everyone.Another negative point is the dacoit part. I felt it an absolute unnecessary addition. They are pnly there as show pieces .Overall, a film that deserved a much better story. Such a weak story and a poor climax let's down the film.
K.G.F: Chapter 2	8.8	Your usual style-over-substance comic book movie. Flimsy plot, really just a vehicle to move you from one action scene to another. Formulaic and cliched: change the characters and settings and you've got pretty much the story of every comic book superhero. Good CGI, but that's a given nowadays.

Our Father	6.6	Disney seemed to be going down the tubes lately, with Atlantis and Home on the Range, but this movie is a masterpiece. If it wasn't for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn't be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don't buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10
Eternals	6.3	No federal law?94 siblings, the result of a cruel and perverted acted by fertility Doctor, Doctor Donald Cline, who used his own semen samples inside his fertility Clinic, his victims unaware of his warped ideas.This was such a good watch, so sickening, a plot that I've seen on a TV drama, where I can't remember, it seems so extreme, so abhorrent, you wouldn't expect to see it in real life, this is that story.I have a full admiration for those that spoke, you get the sense of anger and injustice that each felt, and rightly so, Cline's acts were grotesque, once again we see someone trying to justify their acts in the name of religion.It was arguably a little long, and personally I wasn't too sure about the idea to take it to The Doctor Jones show, that seemed to demean the tragic story somewhat, the look of glee on the faces of the audience members didn't sit right with me.All in all, a shocking, intriguing watch, 8/10.

Morbius	-	-
Moonfall	5.2	"Morbius" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist trying to find the cure behind an extremely rare blood disease. He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.I have to admit that I do not understand the reason behind the low rating of this movie. I am not saying that it's a masterpiece and it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating. I can understand that it's small duration didn't help the main character to evolve and I believe that there was not enough time for the end of it. The interpretations of both Jared Leto who played as Dr. Michael Morbius and Matt Smith who played as Milo were good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that "Morbius" is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and I advise you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.
The Outfit	7.1	It may seem far too early in the year to be claiming such things but it's going to take something truly special (seriously random) for my personal favorite final scene of the year to be anything but Moonfall's need to be seen effort.Without dwelling on that for any longer or entering in spoiler territory overload, it's onto the important matter at hand of exploring Roland Emmerich's latest city/landmark destroying blockbuster.To describe Moonfall as ludicrous, preposterous and utterly bonkers would be underselling just how out there Emmerich's big, dumb and even sometimes fun new film is, as while you may be expecting a typical astronauts and the government save the world from a hurtling towards the Earth Moon type of film, Moonfall goes to many an unexpected place that must surely make it a genuine contender for what will be one of 2022's most bizarre blockbusters.A director who has well and truly given up being anything his not, Emmerich's latest effort is very much cut from the same cloth as his most renowned blockbusters such as Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 and for anyone expecting any type of nuance to be present in Moonfall you're heading for a rude shock, as the films daft script, B-grade worthy performances and pointless/ridiculous plot points and characters litter almost every scene of the films two hour plus runtime.Thankfully it appears as though Emmerich and his cast that includes the paycheck collecting duo of Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson as NASA employees Jocinda Fowl and Brian Harper, Game of Thrones John Bradley as wannabe doctor and mathematician wizz KC Houseman and a few why even bother appearances from Michael Pena and Donald Sutherland all were on the same page with Moonfall's insane premise, meaning that there is fun to be had from watching Catwoman, Ed Warren and Samwell Tarley head to the moon to save humankind, especially as the films unexpected late acts take hold.If you as a viewer fail to get on the same wavelength as the film from the early stages its likely Emmerich's unrefined, loud and CGI infested event will quickly become a film that is hard too sit through, as there's little reason to recommend this film in such a content heavy time for films of all shapes and sizes but there's an argument to be made that these type of daft but knowingly so films have a time and place in our marketplace, despite there being no reason for it to exist outside of mindless entertainment.Final Say -One of Roland Emmerich's most out there carnage-filled blockbusters yet full of cringe and head scratching moments, Moonfall is even more crazy than one might've expected but provides the exact type of experience one would expect from a filmmaker that has long since passed the time where he tried to be anything that his not.2 Fuzz Aldrin's out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)
Pleasure	6.3	This 'little' film very much has the feeling of a stage play. There is really only one set (the tailor Leonard's shop) in which everything happens. To go along with that, it has an almost claustrophobic atmosphere as the different Chicago gangster characters come and go, threaten Leonard and his receptionist Mable (nicely done by Zoey Deutch), argue, leave again. Leonard basically has to outwit them at every twist and turn (and there are lots of twists and turns), and that is about it for the plot. Add to that the fact that no one is entirely who they seem and we get a fascinating hour and a half of intense 'locked room' drama.I wouldn't quite call this minimalist ("Wating for Godot" would classify as minimalist in my books). It's continually absorbing and yet built out of nothing but carefully rendered dialog. Mark Rylance is as always superb, he somehow builds a character out of measured dialog and changes in expression that might not be anything more than a raised eyebrow or a tightening of the mouth. Amazing to watch.I first noticed Zoey Deutch in Before I Fall (2017) in which she was about the only standout. Nice to see that bigger and better roles are coming her way.Saying anything more at all would give away too much since The Outfit is, in part, a mystery as well as suspense drama. Just go see it!
Sing 2	7.4	I didn't think this story was all that compelling or satisfyingly told. There were some details that were memorable, but I really didn't get invested in where it was going. I will agree that the lead actress did an amazing job, and most everyone else brought a realism to their roles, especially since they work in the adult film industry in real life. But I didn't feel like there was much connection between the scenes. Yes, the overall goal of the main character remains consistent, but I didn't feel like we were shown what motivated her to make the specific choices she did much of the time. The effect is that the story doesn't really progress and build believably. Even though it has an outstanding central performance, I felt this was a fairly average drama overall which happened to have a few scenes that were difficult to watch.
Avengers: Endgame	8.4	The last three movies I saw in theater were real dogs. I won't say what they were, but the last one rhymes with "fake tricks." I was in a movie slump, which made me a little apprehensive about "Sing 2." Turns out there was no need to be apprehensive at all, this movie was amazing."Sing 2" had all the old gang minus the mouse. The movie began with a Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) production with a big time talent scout from Redshore City in the audience. Redshore City is like a suped up Las Vegas. Moon's updated musical version of "Alice in Wonderland" wasn't enough to impress the scout, but Moon would not be denied. In his classic hustling fashion he got his theater troupe on the Redshore City stage to secure a full musical, but with one big condition: he'd need Clay Calloway (Bono) in his production. With a new act, a new member, a missing link, and his life on the line, Moon would need a miracle to make it all happen.I don't know why, but I liked "Sing 2" even more than "Sing." The musical numbers, again, were fantastic and the plot was wonderful. All of the characters are easy to like and the music works with the flow of the movie as well as the feel of the movie. Even though the plot is very similar to part one, enough elements were different to make it fresh and thoroughly enjoyable.
Ghostbusters: Afterlife	7.1	After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time, still a perfect ending.
Men	6.5	I saw it preview last night. A film that in some points recalls the first Gostbuster, but which has its own ideology. The characters they present to us are almost all well characterized and useful to the plot. The director did a good job, given the great responsibility he had with this film. Some ideas are very bright and innovative. The first hour and a half is very beautiful, full of jokes and suspenseful scenes, the problem is the last half hour that is lost a bit by recalling the first film a lot. The soundtrack is irrelevant, apart from those two moments when you hear the original themes. Overall it is a good film, not at the levels of the first but certainly superior to the female Gostbuster.
No Time to Die	7.3	Fueled by nightmarish imagery, extremely disturbing sexual themes, a persistently unsettling atmosphere, and an extremely engaging core performance from Jessie Buckley, this film had serious potential to be another superb film from Alex Garland. As a director who has adroitly navigated gender dynamics previously (eg, Ex Machina) this nihilistic take on the insuperable gap between men and women never quite met its potential. The ending does not resolve, and this left us discussing outside of the theater the manner in which this looks like Garland's first misstep. Clearly, there were some brilliant moments, but overall Meh(n) was somewhat of a disappointment.

The Adam Project	-	-
The Shawshank Redemption	9.3	The Adam Project is a sci-fi movie that takes you on a wild, CGI-filled flight that is out of this world-with futuristic technology that makes you excited but also afraid of what could come, and crazy fight scenes that defy gravity. This film also whooshes you into some very realistic topics, too, like grieving for a loved one, being bullied by classmates and accepting who you are.The year is 2050 and time travel exists; however, it is proving to be too dangerous for humanity's own good. After time-traveler pilot Adam Reed (Ryan Reynolds) misses the destination of his mission, to land in 2018, and instead crash-lands in 2022, he is found by his 13-year-old self (Walker Scobell). Together, they embark on a mission to "un-do" time travel so they can fix the past to save the future of the world. But first, the Adams must learn how to get along with each other.The special effects are one of the most notable things about this movie. The wormholes have a mind-boggling appearance, and the ships are straight out of an alien planet. The sci-fi elements look so realistic - as realistic as those can be - that it gives the impression that the cinematographers used time travel themselves to capture these scenes. The overall storyline of the movie is creative, but it does not really have any unique plot twists nor is it fully developed. And as a result, this film comes off a little bland and seems to be missing something. The Adam Project includes some great actors besides Ryan Reynolds, including Jennifer Garner (Adam's mom). In Reynold's performance, you can really feel all his tension and childhood trauma built up, ready to burst. He also manages to make you laugh really hard. Jennifer Garner is the perfect fit for Adam's loving mother who's trying to keep it together as a single mom.This movie has great messages about never giving up and learning to live with your past. There is some profanity, intense fighting scenes, blood, and some adult jokes.I give The Adam Project 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, plus adults. This movie releases exclusively on Netflix on March 11, 2022. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!
Dear Evan Hansen	6.1	This is the sole film in the world that is over 2 hours and yet I wanted another 2. The story, the acting, the sense of justice, the acting, the triumph of good but not in a linear manner, the acting and certainly the authentic feel of the era make this a justified masterpiece.Hollywood has lost the ability to make good films nowadays.Keep churning out the stand up comic Thor, Hollywood.
Firestarter	6.0	The film was good. That's it. There's so much hate and criticism around it. Mind you, a vast amount of film critics panning the film spoke to their distaste of the Broadway production.So why not have an unbiased colleague review it?As a big fan of the source material, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the film. After reviews, I anticipated that I wouldn't like it.Basically: if you're a fan of the stage show; you will enjoy it.PROS:
+Ben Platt's performance is stellar. I don't know why but his age didn't affect me while I watched like I thought it would.+Kaitlyn Dever is a treat. She wasn't mind blowing but she did a very nice job as a film/TV actor in a musical.+Alana's role is expanded in a very smooth, creative and enjoyable way.+The missing songs didn't bother me in the context of the plot.CONS:
+First and foremost Amy Adams (whom I adore) is a disappointment. This is on behalf of the director/writer and actor.+While I was happy Alana's role was expanded, it meant that Heidi's role was trimmed. I enjoyed Julianne Moore and wanted more of her.+It felt too long. For a film targeting teens/families, even with cut songs it ran 2HR 17MIN. There is a lot of breath and Act I wraps at the hour mark, meaning Act II is really stretched. I could have done with 15-30 more minutes trimmed from the film.Overall if you are a fan of the musical or a fan of musicals in general this is worth the watch. I have a feeling like MAMMA MIA, this will get more love 10+ years from now.
Memory	5.6	Good special effects and a great cast make this film above-average, as Stephen King adaptations go (well, it's certainly better than "Maximum Overdrive"). The story may be a bit predictable, partly because King had visited similar territory before ("Carrie", anyone?), but you have to admire the way the film puts you into the action right from the start, omitting any slow introductions, and George C.Scott is such a strong, perverse and eccentric villain that you can't help watching him. (**1/2)
CODA	8.0	The late Roger Ebert had two tests for reviewing films. The first and better-known is to notice whether you are compelled to keep checking your watch toward the middle of a film. Not a good sign. The second test is whether, after the first 20 mins of a film, you have any interest in all in the story, or the characters? Twenty minutes into this film I was more interested in where those positive reviews came from (???) than the actual movie. At 70, Neeson is not only showing his age but the pitch of his voice is off, and the viewer has to strain to hear him. This is a common problem among seniors. I should know. I am one. Save your money.
Turning Red	7.0	I could complain about how they felt the need to adapt a French movie from years ago... but I am just happy that this story gets to be shared with more people. Lovely story, coming off age, family relations. The resulting movie is a great feat, showing people a world they are not familiar with.
Encanto	7.2	There's a reason this movie is a PG and not a U! Everyone having a little turn because a 13 year old girl is given some maxi pads and has crushes on boys - it's not woke, it's reality.And if you have a problem with characters wearing turbans/hijabs, then I really think you need to look deep inside yourself!This movie doesn't feel like a Disney/Pixar because it's cringey and has anime elements - but it's still fun, and my 10 and 8 year old boys had no problem at all with seeing sanitary protection because guess what, they see it in our bathroom every day!
Old	5.8	It looks stunning.. Absolutely beautiful visuals. But the story - I have no idea what it tryes to tell. I get the feel that the movie is about Disney making a movie. Just because!The only thing i took from this movie is that we don't talk about Bruno.
The Suicide Squad	7.2	What to watch? The new gi joe? How about f9? No I think we will settle for old.This movie is unlike any movie I've ever seen, the acting is strange, the plot is strange, the camera work is nauseating at times. And some of the reveals are not done amazingly.But at least its original, the plot makes sense, and when talking about it to my friends I found I always had the proper answer for peoples actions and decision making.The best characters are midsized sidan and the crazy doctor and his wife.The movie has many scenes of exposition that is not hid very well, but overall I think its a movie that begs being seen. I in no way regret watching it and in fact want to watch it again to solidify my opinion .In a time with a lot of movies that you have already seen I guarantee that love it or hate it, you haven't seen anything like it.
The King's Man	6.3	The smartest move DC ever made was to quit concerning themselves with cinematic world building and focus on making (mostly) standalone films that were simply entertaining...and didn't require a master's degree in Snydernomics to appreciate.Their second smartest move was nabbing James Gunn for The Suicide Squad, and not just because the first film was terrible. Material like this needs Gunn's flair for irreverence, clever dialogue and, most importantly, instilling characters with engaging personalities. He may not have created Suicide Squad, but this adaptation has his stamp all over it.And for the first time since his directorial debut, Slither, Gunn is unbound by the restrictions of a PG-13 rating, something else the material really needed. Hence, the film is vivid, violent and vulgar, yet at the same time, seldom feels pandering or gratuitous. Punctuated by gobs of gags and hilarious dialogue, the movie earns its dismemberments and f-bombs along the way. In fact, the whole thing plays very much like Guardians of the Galaxy without a filter.And like Guardians, it's ultimately the characters that matter. Ironically, the one we're most familiar with - Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) - is the least interesting, perhaps because she's already been established with two previous films and there isn't much more Gunn could do with her. But everyone else is wonderfully realized and played perfectly by the ensemble cast. As Bloodsport, the de-facto leader of this new team, Idris Elba strikes the right balance of stoicism and uncertainty, while John Cena (as Peacemaker) once-again demonstrates he's more adept at comedy than pure action. Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmaichian) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) are also fun, each with amusing backstories. But King Shark steals every scene he's in, a perpetually hungry manfish who manages to be both monstrous and endearing (and a role Sylvester Stallone was born to play).With the exception of Task Force X director Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the antagonists are perfunctory. Their plan, however, is gloriously insane; the dictator of Corto Maltese plans to wipe out America using a 30-year-old experiment gone wrong: Starro, a giant extraterrestrial starfish that spawns face-hugging offspring to re-animate & control the dead. This leads to a final act that's as hilarious as it is grotesque, aided by amusing visual effects.Unlike the first film - which was mostly just bells & whistles - The Suicide Squad is the complete package, delivering an abundance of action, humor, violence and well-realized characters. James Gunn's playful approach is just what was needed, making it the best - and maybe the smartest - DC film since Christopher Nolan hung up his spurs.

U.S. Marshals	-	-
The Black Phone	7.4	Okay, so "U.S.Marshalls" is basically just a remake of "The Fugitive". As such, it received lukewarm to cool reviews when it was in the theaters, unjustifiedly so, I think. Although the plot line is a ripoff of the earlier movie, this one does well in keeping us in suspense as to the story behind the central character, and the action is exciting and well-paced. Tommy Lee Jones of course "makes" the film, accompanied by the same cast of deputies as in the earlier movie. There are even "toppers" for the bus crash/train wreck and famous swan dive from the earlier movie. This is a very good escapist action flick.
Scream	6.4	I watched this movie in mid-2021 in a pre-screening, it killed me that I couldn't buy or talk about one of my favorite movies. I was not expecting what I saw in that theater. I didn't have super high hopes but I was proven wrong very very quickly. Would highly suggest watching it, it has some great acting, a great plot, and a satisfying ending.
Love	6.0	I honestly don't understand all this enthusiasm and I find it ABSURD to say that this is the best after the first one, this is the worst of the saga, it's not terrible, it's really a watchable movie and that's it, the plot is weak, the killer and above all his motivations are ridiculous, this is definitely the worst Ghostface of the saga, in the end the film is saved for the level of violence and a couple of giveaways here and there but the first 4 films of Wes were something else.
Gangubai Kathiawadi	7.0	The script is laughable and the acting (often voice-over), too. The 3D sex is well marketed. And yes, during certain scenes people got up and left. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meandering stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well. The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers again and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There's a resplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.You hear music banging inside the club, yet the lovers are outside in halflight. Having sex, obviously. This is a good image of what this film surprisingly achieves best: intimacy. And it fights for that with it's magnificent camera-work and editing.But what would this review be if it didn't talk about the 3D sex? Love and cinema are inseparable. Love stories are why you stick glued to a chair for a couple of hours. Raw sex is part of love, yet, films used to cut to birds necking after a kiss. Then it became steamy windows. Signs, metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, No√© takes that away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing ("finally a love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and I encourage viewers to look beyond.
The Contractor	5.7	This movie tells story a Gangubai and how se contributed to her society. I liked the movie as story is good and acting is also good, but acting can be somehow better.
The Dark Knight	9.0	The pacing of the movie is just off. First 20mind or so nothing really happens at all, then some decent random action scenes spaced out but nothing great. Disappointing overall, just a very generic and not well done action movie. Better to just watch tv episode of swat.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales	6.5	Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. "The Dark Knight" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!
The Matrix Resurrections	5.7	Finally a Pirates of the Caribbean movie that I felt quite at par with the original one. I felt in this movie, the elements of entertainment were quite abundant. Unlike in the 4th installment, I think this one is funnier, more thrilling and gave the sense of happiness at the end. This time,, the movie was not solely telling the story of Jack Sparrow. Instead the other characters, especially Henry and Carina were given quite a lot screen time. It was nice to see Jack Sparrow's charm and wit plus his insistence of helping other people.This movie provided some background story of Jack while he was young, which was very interesting to see. The movie was filled with lots of fun and laughter but also few brief touching moments. The story was good and there were some surprises too. As a high budget movie, the movie was filled with very good special effects (some done by the Industrial Light Magic). I totally loved the effects of the deads (Salazar's crews), his ship and of course the very cool special effects at the end.I also felt that the movie did not have any dull moment. From beginning till the end, there were always something interesting to see. My wife and I were entertained throughout the whole movie which was having a duration of a little over 2 hours. Amazingly, due to the sense of excitement, my wife was able to hold going to the bathroom till finished. I guess she forgotten about it while watching.Actually, even though I looked forward to see this movie, I was a bit skeptical at first about whether this one would be good enough. I felt that the 4th one was a little bit dull, and also a bit forced. The story for that one did not feel strong enough and certainly did not give a lot of impression. But this one really felt it was worthy of giving another sequel after this. Especially if you wait till the very end, after the end-credit scene, where we were given something interesting to ponder. Might be the potential story for the sequel? Perhaps if this one is successful enough.I believe this one really worth to see. I am happy to see Johnny Depp in this movie which I hope would be a commercial success for him. Since his past few movies were unfortunately not really successful ones. Maybe people grew tired of his acting as unusual characters. So if you are looking for something fun, light, interesting movie with funny charming pirate and treasure hunt story, you should definitely watch this one. I am confident you would be entertained like my wife and I were.For my complete review, pls have a look in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id
Licorice Pizza	7.3	Blah blah blah = how much talking and exposition is in this movie. The original matrix had a lot of talking too, but every conversation is intriguing. In this movie, it bored me to death. Almost put me to sleep.Blah blah blah = the mess of a story that is this movie. It's all over the place and feels like a bunch of nonsense mashed together.Blah blah blah = the unclear and uninspiring action. The fight scenes in the first two movie are amongst the best ever put to screen, including Asian cinema. The action in Reloaded is incredible. In this movie, it just feels like action vomit all over the screen. It ranges from mediocre to bad. And only one part is memorable (certain things are falling onto the street). The fight scenes suffer from close ups and quick cuts, something we never see in the originals.The more I think about it, a 4 star rating seems generous. But that's how I felt leaving the theater. There is some good here. But I don't think I'd bother giving it another chance. (1 viewing, 12/23/2021)
Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood	7.6	Generous with a 5 cos of Sean Penn n Bradley Cooper's small roles.This movie has absolutely no character development and the screenplay is abysmal.Better watch Crazy Stupid Love. At least it's funny.
Nightmare Alley	7.1	I don't write reviews often, but this time I felt I had to. The reason being that many of the earlier reviews of this film meant that this movie is too long and not worth seeing. I respectfully disagree.The film is long, I give you that, but the deliberate pace puts you in the right mood and it tells an intriguing story with sexy chicks, real men and a setting that seems real - and I really loved it. Cinema magic!
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald	6.5	3 out of 5 stars.Nightmare Alley is a fair psychological thriller film that may not be Guillermo del Toro best film. It does have a neo noir direction and a story of a carny getting mixed up with a psychiatrist that may not be who she seems and him pretending to be a medium. Decent plot. The script and direction is slow and boring. The cast ensemble is good with great performances led by Bradley Cooper. The film is quite forgettable.
Free Guy	7.1	Almost impossible to keep up with what was going on! Just jumped from one thing to the next with no development, such a shame
Deep Water	5.4	For the first 20 or so minutes of "Free Guy" I was enthralled. As I watched the film on HBO Max, I called my wife over the watch and we both laughed and enjoyed the film. However, as the film progressed the movie lost some of its momentum...and this slowed to a crawl later in the movie. Why? Well, the same problem with "Free Guy" is the same with "Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu" (incidentally, both starring the likable Ryan Reynolds)....plot. Or, more like it, too much plot. Both films did great jobs world building but after that, they both seemed to insist too much on a plot involving a baddie...which is very formulaic but also reduced the magic from the story. I would have rather seen more of the exciting world in both...and less baddies.The story is an odd one...one that is similar to combining "The Truman Show", "Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu", "They Live", and an online game that plays a bit like "Grand Theft Auto"! And, the main character, Guy (Reynolds), is an NPC (a non-player character) in a massive world created for online gamers. However, something odd happens.... Guy begins to develop consciousness...and it is driven home when he dons a pair of sunglasses. Suddenly, he can see power ups, health power ups and more! What's next? Well, a baddie...and one whose motivations were vague.Overall, the film is still worth watching...it's good. But the momentum which is going so fast when the film begins just can't be maintained through the course of the film.By the way, there are no extra scenes. When the movie ends and the end titles begins, the story is over...just in case you're tempted to keep watching.
Forrest Gump	8.8	... this film is just weird-stupid in sooo many different ways... storyline is the absurd worst... along with the fact no matter how attractive she might be, that attractiveness is totally lost in the horrid character she portrays in this bleak-production... his acting is zombie-like to a ludicrous degree (normal-Affleck)... why movies like this get made at all is testament to the crap audiences are willing to accept over & again... somewhat improves with a second viewing... still crudely-ridiculous numerous scenes... there's greater appreciation for the overall story, ludicrous as it may be... the 1st viewing exposes the movie's flaws... in a 2nd, you'll know-bypass-them.. letting enjoyment of their performances happen to a greater degree... a production that cannot-mustn't be-taken-too-seriously, just like the hidden-freaky-'marriage' it exposes... look for Catherine Springer's March 16th review... nails-it.
Sonic the Hedgehog	6.5	I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, or the second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you like it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the movie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says a lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing. Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually just looking for the most "action," gore and sex they can find, and haven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and life.Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more. Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies -- if not THE greatest -- ever made.
Ku bei	6.5	Sonic The Hedgehog is an action comedy movie based on the SEGA video game series of the same name. Starring James Marsden and Jim Carrey, it is a fast-moving adventure (obviously) that should entertain newcomers and keep fans of the original series satisfied.In the small town of Green Hills, Montana, a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) lives in hiding after being forced out of his original dimension due to his powers of super speed. After accidentally causing a blackout throughout the whole area, Sonic attracts the attention of Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey), an eccentric evil genius whom the government has hired to track Sonic down for experimental purposes. Now on the run once again, Sonic enlists the help of local police officer Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) to aid him in avoiding capture and hopefully make a new friend in the process.Even if you aren't a hardcore fan of the series, Sonic The Hedgehog provides a nice amount of fun action and quirky humour to draw in even the most casual of moviegoer. I myself was a Nintendo kid growing up, preferring to play as the Italian plumber instead of the blue hedgehog, but SEGA and their mascot character always had my respect for being worthy rivals during the video game wars of the 90s, and the same can be said for this. In fact, this film seems to strongly acknowledge Sonic's 1990s roots, from his love of chili dogs to listening to music on a boombox. Of course, there are some references to modern trends but they are kept to a minimum likely so that the film will age better.Jeff Fowler, who makes his directorial debut for a feature film, does a fine job juggling his storytelling duties with showing off some solid special effects along the way, especially on Sonic himself. It is well known by now that Sonic's original design for this film was poorly received by the public so it was decided that his overall look would be changed. This worked well in the film's favour as not only does he better resemble his video game self, but he even feels more naturally integrated into the real world. We watch as Sonic dashes around causing mischief and escaping danger through different environments like the big city or the quiet countryside, deriving enjoyment along the way. This led to some amusing Quicksilver/Deadpool-esque moments which provided great comic relief during several action scenes.Comedian Ben Schwartz was a great pick to provide the voice and motion-capture of Sonic himself, both emanating the character's trademark cocky attitude while also showcasing his loneliness and longing for true friendship. This, in turn, makes him more relatable to the audience and causes him to have more human traits than some of the actual people in the film. James Marsden also gave a likeable performance as Tom Wachowski, not merely being relegated to the straight man role but also having his fair share of funny moments as well. However, it is Jim Carrey who steals the show as Dr. Robotnik. I'm not sure whether it was seeing how perfectly tailored the character was to his comedic talents or if it was just how nostalgic it felt to see him acting like his over-the-top 90s self again, but virtually everything he said and did had me laughing out loud. I hope we will see more of Carrey's portrayal of the character in the near future, which reportedly he has expressed interest in doing.In the end, even though the film isn't groundbreaking by any means, it still provides much needed entertainment thanks to its respectful take on the source material that, like POK√âMON Detective Pikachu before it, definitely feels more like how video games should be handled for the big screen treatment. There is certainly potential for other game franchises to be adapted into movies with a similar style and it is starting to feel as though the "video game curse" may be fading away altogether. There are two bonus mid-credit scenes worth staying back for, and while they aren't of Masahiro Sakurai approaching Sonic about the Smash initiative, they should excite fans of the series just as much.I rate it 7/10
Wrath of Man	7.1	What is the human without constraints? A monster..
In "the sadness" a virus mutation transforms the infected! - this has nothing to do with zombies, nothing at all - into such unregulated creatures.For fans of "the crossed" from Garth Ennis, this will be quite known territory. Although where Crossed can show this happening at a broader scale "the sadness" always seems quite limited. Even though there are a few nice Splatter scenes and especially the beginning is quite atmospheric, the more the movie nears it¬¥s -predictable- ending, the less is actually happening.Six points for the bravery to actually try this kind of stuff. Could have been much better though.
American Psycho	7.6	Well, wow. Just wow. Guy Ritchie does it again.I have to say that if you enjoy movies from director Guy Ritchie or enjoy movies that has Jason Statham on the cast list, then you definitely have to sit down to watch the 2021 action crime thriller "Wrath of Man". This movie was through the roof.The title of the movie, though, was something that sort of gave off a biblical vibe, so I personally didn't think it was a title suitable for this particular movie.The storyline, as written by Guy Ritchie, was one that swept me up from the very beginning and took me along on a very exciting thrill ride. And I do like the fact that the movie wasn't all that linear and predictable. Writer and director Guy Ritchie managed to come up with something that is every bit as much action packed as it is intense. And that made for a very enjoyable movie."Wrath of Man" has a rather impressive cast ensemble, with the likes of Jason Statham, Holt McCallany, Josh Hartnett, Jeffrey Donovan, Scott Eastwood and Andy Garcia, along with others that were also nicely cast. I must say that Jason Statham was really good in this movie. But I was very thrilled with the performance that Scott Eastwood put on, he was just phenomenal in "Wrath of Man".And the character gallery in "Wrath of Man" was quite well written, and there were some very interesting and nicely detailed characters throughout the movie.This movie provided me with genuine entertainment from the very beginning and up to the very end. So this is indeed a movie that I can - and will - warmly recommend you sit down to watch, should you find yourself presented with the opportunity to do so.My rating of "Wrath of Man" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.
Doctor Sleep	7.3	The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality.
People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Feynman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despairIt's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society. Bateman's interpretation of the world is skewed by his inflated ego and his evident psychosis as well as presumably multiple mental illnesses. Bateman is a killer, but still, he's not the killer he thinks he is, as he goes insane he can't distinguish reality from fantasy. His over the top chainsaw massacre style killings may be an aestheticized elaboration on partial truths, ultimately the film doesn't care. The more significant point of the movies absurdity is that within his society Batemans not the psycho at all he's just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality, secretly discontented American psychos. Bateman is surrounded by like-minded superficial people obsessed with all the wrong things like making impossible reservations at Dorsia and the tasteful thickness of their business cards. Within the homogenized upper-class elite identities blur as everyone strives after a generic yet highly specific image of success.Everyone we see in Bateman's company appears to be the same person. It's no wonder that identity is mistaken continuously and swapped throughout the film. The lawyer has mistaken Paul Allen or perhaps Batman has killed the wrong person becomes not only plausible but also an expression of the general confusion resulting from the loss of individual identity.Meanwhile, although Batman tries like the rest to fit in, the emptiness of his lifestyle also fuels a craving to stand out. To escape the conformity that he on some level despises Batman leads a second life as a killer, where he's unfettered from the bounds of society. Although he actually wants to be seen as a murderer as someone different from the rest of society Bateman is denied even the satisfaction by every self-absorbed yuppie he meets. When he's seen stuffing a body into the trunk of a car, the witness is only interested in the bag.This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.
Venom: Let There Be Carnage	6.0	While I don't consider it a masterpiece, I did enjoy the classic Kubrick rendition of The Shining, and I understand why it has the fan base it does. Seeing the trailer for Doctor Sleep and discovering Ewan McGregor was playing an adult Danny Torrance, I thought the concept might be interesting.Everyone acts fantastic in this film. I thought Ewan McGregor built a very nice character. If I had imagined how Danny might have turned out after the first film ended, I don't think I would have predicted it much different. There are a few intense moments with the villains (Primarily Rose the Hat and Snakebite Andi) that made me absolutely hate them (which is a good thing). I think the things they do in the film would make anyone want them to see a terrible fate.I found myself smiling at the call-backs to the classic movie, and when Danny returns to the Overlook Hotel. It's been a while since I've said to myself "Oh wow, there it is" that many times at a film. I will say there are a couple scenes at the Overlook that feel like they were written in to make the fan base happy rather than be part of the story, but nothing that drags on too long.As far as it being a scary film, you may jump a few times, and some scenes are a little disturbing, but by Stephen King standards, it's more of a suspense film.An advantage I'll give this film over The Shining is that even though the film is two and a half hours, it doesn't get boring. Not that The Shining was boring, but it is a very slow film. Stanley Kubrick loved to throw in very long shots in his films, and while I personally think they worked sometimes, other times they were excessive, and in The Shining, they were excessive to me.I think this film is at least worth a watch whether you're a fan of the Kubrick film or not, because it's sort of it's own film in a way. It shows enough of the classic film to have a connection, but also has a story different enough and good enough to hold it's own.
Father Stu	6.9	I've seen both Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson act their behinds off and it was great. I've seen humor and dark humor work wonders for DC. I've seen Michelle Williams look beautiful and amazingly desirable. None of these feature in Venom: Let There Be Carnage.Instead you get a constant gay married couple bickering between Venom and Brock which is supposed to be insightful and funny, but isn't, a cardboard psychopathic villain that could have been sympathetic with just a few edits, a pointless villain girlfriend that has no influence on the plot of the film whatsoever, even though she has a superpower she is inconsequential, a pointless hero girlfriend who is there just to be a damsel in distress, copy pasted from the bad Spiderman films, a policeman who is there just to be the always late to the joke guy and... Dan? Who cares about Dan?! I swear the most interesting character in this film is the mean Chinese lady at the store. There is no chemistry between any of the characters. None!But the worse problem is that there is no story, no tension, nothing to solve. The interaction between hero and villain is minimal yet stretching imagination and both their paths when separate are boring uninteresting bad writing.Even the CGI fights feel pointless, as two blobs fight each other by hitting and throwing each other. Venom knows ALL the weaknesses of a symbiont and does nothing with it. Brock knows his symbiont and does nothing with it.The more I write in this review the more stars disappear from the rating, so I will just stop. This could have been the exact same movie with ten times less budget, cheap CGI and unknown actors. No one would have noticed a difference. And there is one end credits scene that is more interesting in its implications than the entire movie!! Ugh.
The VVitch: A New-England Folktale	6.9	Truth is stranger than fiction. I enjoyed the film but wish there had been subtitles. Sometimes some of the characters mumbled so much that even though there were extreme close ups with no distractions, many times I was unable to understand what was being said. I began to wonder if there was something wrong with my ability to follow the movie until afterward when I went in the restroom, I heard everyone in there saying the same thing. Probably some of the problem might have had to do with unfamiliar slang but most of it was the way the words were enunciated. Don't let that stop you from seeing it though. It is still worth seeing.
Runway 34	7.4	A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.There are not many films about witches (as opposed to other horror villains). There are even fewer that are actually rather good. And also very few set in the time when witches were still very much believed to exist in the real world. This film is not only very good, but crafts an entire world -- a Salem-ish environment where it is not hysteria but reality.While there is not much that could be said bad about this film, there is one thing I would like to single out above all else fr praise. The sound design. Wow. The colors, the costumes, the acting and more are all good, but this film is very rich in sound in ways hat we very rarely hear. Not just in horror but anywhere, and it is a real shame that movies like this are not often noticed by the Academy.
London Fields	3.9	The directing and acting was really good. Everyone did a great job especially Ajay Devgan coz he even directed the movie. Storyline was not some extraordinary but it was good. The intense scenes were amazing. Overall the movie was good and worth watching.Guys please watch this movie instead of heropanti 2 and stop trolling this without any reason.
The Evil Dead	7.4	When hiring an actress to be a femme fatale one has to hire someone who has allure. This actress poses the the emotions and simply is too young or simply doesnt posses the allure that is needed for this role. The story is good but there is such an artificial quality from the two leads, this girl/woman and Billy Bob Thorton. Good story and good filming etc but the acting was intolerble.
Dog	6.5	It has many virtues for see it again. From the humor and make up, to the animation and Bruce Campbell in action, from the nice frame about the poor Sumerians to the end and, sure, the fight scenes, all is seductive, making The Evil Dead a classic. A film of detals, it defines, in fair manner, the horror of the period.
House of Gucci	6.6	To the person that said it's been done before sure but never this story I'm sure there's very few about a dog from the army. Channing Tatum was superb throughout I loved Dog (Lulu) the journey story and bonding was so lovely! So much wildness, charm, endearment, and great dialogue throughout; amazing movie I'd recommend to anyone!
Happy Gilmore	7.0	There were quite a number of reasons for wanting to see 'House of Gucci'. The advertising did intrigue and did suggest a film that would be over the top but entertaining in its own way. Ridley Scott's filmography is hit and miss, brilliant at his best like with 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' though some of his films, such as 'GI Jane' and 'Robin Hood' ('Legend' is underrated in my view), are not too great. The main draw though was the cast, with Lady Gaga (an immensely gifted performer and inspirational person) being a big selling point for many.For me though, bigger selling points were seeing two of my favourite actors Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons again (and reunited after 'A Merchant in Venice'). Jared Leto has always been very take and leave. 'House of Gucci' turned out to be one of those difficult to rate and review sort of films for me, it is going to be one of those films that some are going to love and others are going to hate (with some in between). It is a hugely flawed film, but there was also a lot to enjoy at the same time. As far as Scott's films go, it's a middling effort. Neither one of his best or worst.'House of Gucci' has a lot that is good in my view. Have very little to complain about when it comes to how it looks, apart from some editing being in need of a tightening in the final act. The Italian scenery and the costumes are truly stunning though and the camerawork is similarly sumptuous. Scott's direction is uneven dramatically but is very impressive on a technical level, especially in his use of multiple cameras (which must make it easy for actors to know where to look). The soundtrack is also wonderful and beautifully operatic in scope, though not always well placed, but from a standalone point of view there are no complaints here.Despite the very all over the place accents, with a mix of exaggerated (Leto, to almost cartoonish effect in his case) or barely there (Irons, am a huge fan of Irons but will never deny about accents not being a forte of his), most of the acting is fine. Lady Gaga kills it as Patrizia, who is a very interesting and well fleshed out character here, bringing charm, effortless charisma and menace to her. It has been said that her accent isn't great, as far as the cast goes it's actually the most convincing one along with Salma Hayek's. Adam Driver is a good deal more understated, one of the few in the cast to play it very straight, but he is also compelling and his character growth/decent is believable. They have great chemistry together.The supporting cast on the whole support them well, Pacino coming off best having a whale of a time as Aldo. Irons brings vulnerability and authority to patriarch Rodolfo and Salma Hayek gives some of her best acting in years. Really liked the chemistry on the whole, Lady Gaga and Driver are great together as are Lady Gaga and Hayek, while that between Irons and Pacino is a joy. 'House of Gucci' does have a few great individual scenes, and one of the best is the magnificent encounter between Irons and Pacino. Personally thought the first half was fine and that it set up the intrigue and characters extremely well. As well as a few funny moments, Rodolfo's verbal brutalising of Paolo was gold and sums up the viewer's opinion of him and his work perfectly.On the other hand, 'House of Gucci' has a number of shortcomings. One performance didn't work for me and that was Leto. Unrecognisable in much talked about(the talk of social media when advertising was first revealed) makeup that deserves its own film, he overplays his role, especially when the comic relief becomes more dominant, and belongs in a completely different film. Yes the film is very over the top in tone, but Leto's performance veered on excess and too much of a Super Mario Brothers caricature. There are pacing issues, the rather underdeveloped family business stuff drags, sometimes to the point of stalling, due to the lack of tension and gravitas that was not there enough. And other parts come over as very choppy and incomplete feeling, like the final act. The second half needed a tightening up, which would have made the film less overlong (and it is a film that could have been 25 minutes shorter easily).Also found the ending very rushed and anti-climactic, handled with too much of an indifferent shrug. After spending so long on the family stuff (and not developing that enough) and the increasingly uneasy spurts of comedy, the event that caused such a sensation is just too throwaway in treatment. Tonally, 'House of Gucci' is messy, the comedy going for the campy approach that goes too far into pantomime in the second half and some of the serious moments being too melodramatic. Tonal shifts can be uneasily abrupt.The script has some funny and intriguing moments, but is on the whole too overwritten in tone (Leto's comedy increasingly gets too much), bland emotionally (the descent into revenge is not examined enough) and also too much of a trying to include as many iconic lines as possible. Some of the line delivery has to be heard to be believed, can imagine right now the amount of reaction gifs online in regard to some of the more comedic lines and Leto's body language.Concluding, hugely flawed but also quite fun when taking it for what it is. 5.5/10 (was struggling which score of 5 or 6 to give it but decided to go in between and round it up)
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings	7.4	Adam Sandler has a very funny movie here that works like no other since Caddyshack.  Sandler plays a lazy guy who has to save his grandmother's house from being removed.  So, he starts to play golf in a way that only Sandler can.  He is also instructed by Carl Weathers (who memorably played Apollo Creed in Rokcy), and wathcing his scenes I had to leave the theater from laughing so much (he had a wooden hand and it always gets knocked off). Sandler knows how to keep people rolling in the ailes, and this proves it. A++
The Danish Girl	7.1	Really entertaining movie. Actors were great Simu Liu brought it big time he is excellent as the main character. Awkwafina is hilarious and I wish she had more screen time. As far as Marvel movies goes, it's not the best one but still very good.
Avengers: Infinity War	8.4	"He's comfortable in his own skin," is usually seen as a compliment. It means that the person in question knows who he (or she) is and is content with that sense of identity. I dare speculate that it's a condition to which we all aspire. Unfortunately, many people around the world lack that inner peace because of a question of gender identity. Regardless of what others think about such an existential situation, people who feel uncomfortable with the biology with which they were born often suffer greatly over this conflict within their hearts and minds. They cannot be comfortable in their own skin, because they don't feel that their skin is really theirs. Before the somewhat more enlightened times of the 21st century, people who identified with a gender other than that to which biology assigned them suffered even more than some do today. In ages past, those people had little opportunity to make changes that would make themselves look on the outside as they felt on the inside. "The Danish Girl" (R, 2:00) is one such story.Inspired by the true story of early 20th century married Danish painters Einar and Gerda Wegener, like David Ebershoff's 2000 book on which it's based, "The Danish Girl" is a fictionalized account of Einar's physical transition to Lili Elbe. Neither the book nor Lucinda Coxon's screenplay makes any claim to absolute historical accuracy. This story changes many of the facts for dramatic purposes. The real-life situation of Lili and Gerda's life was much more complicated than we see on screen. The result is a film that tells a simple story in a way that elicits empathy for the protagonists and enlightens the audience.Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne plays Einar/Lili, and Alicia Vikander, his wife, Gerda. The couple lives in a large apartment in Copenhagen, Denmark, where they both make a living painting. At first, Einar's landscapes are more in demand and more respected than Gerda's portraits. One day when Gerda was in a hurry to finish a portrait of their mutual friend and ballerina, Oola (Amber Heard), Gerda asks Einar to stand in as a model by putting on Oola's stockings and heels and holding up Oola's dress in front of him. Although the scene is played with a combination of humor and awkwardness, it's obvious that Einar likes the clothes. He starts trying on his wife's clothes which gives birth to an idea. Gerda is a bit conflicted, but being the open-minded person she is, she suggests that her husband dress up as a woman to attend an art world function that he had been trying to avoid. And just like that, Lili is born.The thing is that Einar had always felt like a female and being Lili was the first opportunity that he had really had to express what he felt was his true gender. Einar wears women's clothes and make-up more and more often, both at home and out in public. Lili even begins secretly seeing a local man named Henrik (Ben Whishaw). Gerda is understandably upset by all this, but she never criticizes her husband's inner turmoil or its outward manifestations. She wants to understand, and the more she does, the more she mourns her marriage, which she sees as slipping away. However, as all this is happening, her art career begins to take off. She paints Lili more and more, in fashionable clothes and in little or no clothes. As Gerda's style develops, increasing demand for her paintings soon leads the couple to move to Paris.In Paris, Lili blossoms as a person, even as she seeks a more permanent solution to her feeling that her biology doesn't match her identity. She sees doctors whose diagnoses are wide-ranging, but are mainly focused on Einar/Lili having some sort of mental deficiency. Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenarts), a childhood friend of Einar, tries to help, but he can do little more than offer moral support to the couple. Finally, Lili and Gerda find a possible solution in the person of German doctor Kurt Warnekros (Sebastian Koch). Dr. Warnekros offers to perform practically unprecedented sex reassignment surgery on Lili."The Danish Girl" is a very sensitive portrayal of a very tumultuous experience in the lives of two real people. Whether you sympathize with the situation of the two main characters or not, you're likely to empathize with them as people. While presenting a story about the controversial topic of gender identity, Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper also tells a very human story within the framework of the movie's plot. At its core, this is a tale of love and loss, of tolerance and devotion, of¬Ö feeling comfortable in one's own skin. Although some Movie Fans may find some of the situations, images and the brief but graphic nudity (both female and male) to be disturbing, and the plot does drag at times, one of the main reasons to see this movie is for the award-worthy performances by the two leads. With impressive emotional range and depth, both Redmayne and Vikander make this story surprisingly rich and relatable. Hooper draws even more focus (literally) to the characters' feelings by choosing especially significant moments to bring his camera in very close for a tight focus on the characters' faces, while allowing everything beyond their necks to go out of focus. "The Danish Girl" deserves credit for its honesty, its emotional power and its succinct presentation of a very complicated story. However, some of the changes in the story seem designed to increase the impact of the story, a move I would call emotionally manipulative. For that and other reasons, I just wish that this otherwise excellent film had been more historically accurate. "B"
Metal Lords	6.7	I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.
